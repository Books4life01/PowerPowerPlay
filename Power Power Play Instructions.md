First, make sure you have the JDK(java development kit installed. You can easily install it from this [link](https://download.oracle.com/java/19/latest/jdk-19_windows-x64_bin.exe)

Then run the Power Power PLayV3 exe file to ensure everything is working. If you get a message saying a JNI error has occurred it is probably because you didn't download the JDK
